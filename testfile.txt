The finals of the Fortnite World Cup are taking place in a stadium in New York, with the winner set to earn more prize money than Simona Halep and Novak Djokovic won as Wimbledon champions.

Forty million players attempted to qualify over 10 weeks of online competition but only 100 finalists have a shot at winning the $3m (£2.4m) prize at Flushing Meadows.

With $30m to be awarded in total, the prize pool will be the biggest given away at an e-sports event so far - until the annual DOTA 2 tournament in August.

All finalists will take home at least $50,000 and the runner-up, as well as third and fourth-placed finishers, will all become millionaires.
